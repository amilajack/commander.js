> ## üõ† Status: In Development
> Joker is currently in development. It's on the fast track to a 1.0 release, so we encourage you to use it and give us your feedback, but there are things that haven't been finalized yet and you can expect some changes.

A modern fork of [commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js/)

## Goals

* **Type Safe**: Improved compatibility with type systems
* **Improved Documentation**: Provide a plethora of examples along with high quality API docs
* **Coloring**: Built in support for colored output
